# Diabetes-Prediction-Analysis
The Project purpose is to predict  whether the patient has diabetes or not on the basis of the features.

# overview

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.



## Dataset Information:

-Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant

-Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

-Blood Pressure:Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

-Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

-Insulin: 2-Hour Serum Insulin (mu U/ml)

-BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/ height in m2)

-Diabetes Pedigree Function: It provides information about diabetes history in relatives and genetic relationship of those relatives with patients. Higher Pedigree Function means patient is more likely to have diabetes.

-Age:Age (years)

-Outcome: Class Variable (0 or 1) where ‘0’ denotes patient not having diabetes and ‘1’ denotes patient having diabetes.

## Models

Linear Regression is used when our dependent variable is continuous in nature for example weight, height, numbers, etc. and in contrast, Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable is binary or limited for example: yes and no, true and false, 1 or 2.

Sigmoid Activation Function is basically a probabilistic approach towards decision making and ranges in between 0 to 1, so when we have to make a decision or to predict an output we use this activation function because of the range is the minimum, therefore, prediction would be more accurate.
